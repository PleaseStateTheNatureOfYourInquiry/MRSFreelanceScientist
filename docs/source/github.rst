GitHub repositories
===================

I believe in the practice of Open Science, Open Code, Open Data. 
Especially after following the Transform to Open Science online accreditation (2024) I have been implementing the Open Science practice and I have been using my `GitHub <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry>`__ to share.


Software repositories
---------------------

.. _generaltools:

* `General Tools for Scientists <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/GeneralToolsForScientists>`_ is a set of pseudo Python classes with functions designed to assist working with any kind of digital data and (data) files. While working on a variety of different science projects over the years I kept reinventing pieces of code and googling for details that I kept forgetting. General Tools is a collection of more generalised forms of these pieces of code. At the moment there is **HandyTools** and **DataTools**.

.. _venustools:

* `Venus Tools <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusTools>`_ is a set of two pseudo Python classes I developed to help analyse Venus Express Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC) data (**VMCTools**) and temperatures profiles obtained from the Venus Radio (VeRa) radio occultation experiments (**VeRaTools**). 

.. _ncdrt:

* `Nançay Continuum Data Reduction Tool <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/NancayContinuumDataReductionTool>`_ is a tool with a GUI written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) to reduce continuum radio observations performed by the Nançay Radio Telescope.


Science repositories

.. _venust-uv:

* **Search for a correlation between temperature structure and UV contrasts in the clouds of Venus**. `GitHub repository <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusResearchWorkBook>`__ and corresponding `workbook <https://venusresearchworkbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. The results are in the process of being submitted for :ref:`publication <publication36>`.

.. _mooncha:

* **Mooncha**: experimentations with growing the tea plant (Camellia Sinensis Sinensis) under off-planet conditions. `GitHub repository <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/mooncha>`_ and `corresponding workbook <https://mooncha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

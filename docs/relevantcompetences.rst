Coding / Software
-----------------

I have been writing code ever since I got involved with research in 1991.
My code skills much increased while developing a complete software landscape (including GUIs) for data acquisition, reduction and analysis
for cardiac rhythm studies at the Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 2018 and 2024.
Unfortunately I cannot share any of these applications on GitHub, since sadly practices of Open Science are uncommon in medical research.
Please see my :ref:`GitHub repositories <githubrepositories>`.

Maarten Roos-Serote freelance scientist
=======================================

When it comes to space research, there is so much exciting and important stuff happening at this time.
In addition to all the scientific advances it clearly seems we are on the verge of humanity's next steps expanding into space.
Whatever those steps will look like, they will be an important ones.
In some capacity or another I plan to continue to be a part of it.

My formal training and research background is in planetary science and astrophysics.
I have been active in this field of research with since 1991.
I am also fascinated by the prospect of using space resources to solve problems both in space and on Earth.

My career started out following a classical academic trajectory with a PhD (1997), a postdoc contract,
an academic research position (1999 - 2007).
As of 2007 it started to take different and interesting turns. 
I have been working as a freelancer and I thrive much better working this way: shorter or longer temporary contracts, changing topics.
In addition to being a scientist, I am also a factual filmmaker
(see `portfolio <https://lightcurvefilms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/portfolio.html>`_ for selected links).


What I bring to the table is a critical view and a lot of hands-on experience with data analysis, data wrangling, data management,
and research software development.
I will master new techniques whenever these are required to find solutions to a problem.

Coding / Software
-----------------

I have been writing code ever since I got involved with research in 1991.
My code skills much increased while developing a complete software landscape (including GUIs) for data acquisition, reduction and analysis
for cardiac rhythm studies at the Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 2018 and 2024.
Unfortunately I cannot share any of these applications on GitHub, as practices of Open Science are uncommon in medical research.

Techniques
----------

* Radiative transfer modeling of planetary atmospheres;
* Reduction and analysis of visible photometry of Solar System minor bodies;
* Acquisition, reduction and analysis of radio astronomical observations of Mars, using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (the Netherlands) and the Nançay Radio Telescope (France)(:ref:`Nançay Continuum Data Reduction Tool <ncdrt>`).
